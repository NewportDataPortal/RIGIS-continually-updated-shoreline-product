The data were created by the National Ocean Service, National Geodetic Survey as part of its ongoing mission to provide base maps of the coastline. The data are made available through a web-based delivery system.

  Description:
    Abstract: These data provide available contemporary high-resolution national shoreline. The Continually Updated Shoreline Product is provided via the National Shoreline Data Explorer application.
    Purpose: Shoreline is a foundation data layer that may be used for mapping and charting applications, developing models for tsunamis, storm surge, and coastal flooding as well as predicting sea level change and forecasting pollution trajectories. It can assist decision-makers in developing comprehensive coastal-ready community plans, managing coastal resources, delineating and mitigating hazard events, making projections for wave and wind energy utilization, conducting environmental analyses and monitoring, and more.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Shoreline attributes are from NGS's Coastal Cartographic Object Attribute Source Table (C-COAST) for data consistency. The C-COAST attributes were visually inspected with contemporary imagery to verify attribute accuracy.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Line segments which did not close were snapped by the nodes to create consistently tied strings without node dangles. Lines conform to topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines. Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines.
  Completeness_Report: The completeness of the data reflects the content of the sources and may not include a complete shoreline data set.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Compiled to meet the meters reported in HOR_ACC (horizontal accuracy) at the 95% confidence level. This predicted accuracy of compiled well-defined points is a deductive estimate.

      Source_Contribution: The shoreline is a representation based on an office interpretation of imagery or derived from Lidar. Shoreline vectors were verified with contemporary imagery. Sources of non-NOAA vector shoreline included U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and U.S. Geological Survey. Non-NOAA imagery sources for interpreting shoreline included USDA-FSA Aerial Photography Field Office, ESRI Imagery World 2D (USGS, U.S. Geological Survey, and U.S. Department of Agriculture), Bing Maps Imagery Service, and Google Earth (TerraMetrics and DigitalGlobe).
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: All features were attributed to conform to a subset of the NGS 'Coastal Cartographic Object Attribute Source Table' (C-COAST) attribution scheme. Current shoreline sources include individual National Shoreline projects, Lidar derived, automated feature extracted, monoscopically compiled, and non-NOAA sources of shoreline that were merged and stitched together and verified with contemporary imagery. The CUSP shoreline may include limited compilation from contemporary verification imagery (National Agriculture Imagery Program) if tidal influences minimally influenced the horizontal position. Some water courses were closed off with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory vectors. Edits may have been made to sections of the original shoreline vertices, as opposed to new compilation, to reflect the contemporary position.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Data for Rhode Island was downloaded from the NOAA Shoreline Data Explorer. These data were reprojected to the Rhode Island state plane feet coordinate system from geographic coordinates. Data were compared with RIGIS dataset Shoreline and Islands (1989) and there were many areas where the CUSP shoreline was a more accurate representation of current ground conditions. This assessment led to the inclusion of these data on the RIGIS website. 
        While the CUSP data is compile from a variety of source types, from a variety of different collection dates, this shoreline will provide a good cartographic representation of the Rhode Island coastline.

          Enumerated_Domain_Value: Natural.Mean High Water
          Enumerated_Domain_Value_Definition: A shoreline proxy representing the land/water interface at the mean high water tidal datum. The average of all the high water heights observed over the National Tidal Datum Epoch (18.6 years). For stations with shorter series, simultaneous observational comparisons are made with a control tide station in order to derive the equivalent datum of the National Tidal Datum.

          Enumerated_Domain_Value_Definition: A shoreline proxy representing the land/water interface at the mean high water tidal datum. The average of all the high water heights observed over the National Tidal Datum Epoch (18.6 years). For stations with shorter series, simultaneous observational comparisons are made with a control tide station in order to derive the equivalent datum of the National Tidal Datum. An approximate modifier indicates shoreline which does not meet the definition of Accurate, but is generally considered to be within 100 feet (30.5 meters) of its correct geographic location. Used to denote shoreline obscured by shadows or line-of-sight blockage, such as under bridges.

          Enumerated_Domain_Value_Definition: A shoreline proxy representing the mean surface elevation datum as determined by averaging the heights of the water at equal intervals of time, usually hourly. Mean water level is used in areas of little or no range in tide.
