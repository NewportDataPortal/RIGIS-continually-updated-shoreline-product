<othercit>In 1807, Thomas Jefferson created an organization named the Survey of the Coast "...to cause a survey to be taken of coasts of the United States, in which shall be designated the islands and shoals and places of anchorage..." The data were created by the National Ocean Service, National Geodetic Survey as part of its ongoing mission to provide base maps of the coastline. The data are made available through a web-based delivery system.</othercit>

<descript>
<abstract>These data provide available contemporary high-resolution national shoreline. The Continually Updated Shoreline Product is provided via the National Shoreline Data Explorer application.</abstract>
<purpose>Shoreline is a foundation data layer that may be used for mapping and charting applications, developing models for tsunamis, storm surge, and coastal flooding as well as predicting sea level change and forecasting pollution trajectories. It can assist decision-makers in developing comprehensive coastal-ready community plans, managing coastal resources, delineating and mitigating hazard events, making projections for wave and wind energy utilization, conducting environmental analyses and monitoring, and more.</purpose>

<srccontr>The shoreline is a representation based on an office interpretation of imagery or derived from Lidar. Shoreline vectors were verified with contemporary imagery. Sources of non-NOAA vector shoreline included U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and U.S. Geological Survey. Non-NOAA imagery sources for interpreting shoreline included USDA-FSA Aerial Photography Field Office, ESRI Imagery World 2D (USGS, U.S. Geological Survey, and U.S. Department of Agriculture), Bing Maps Imagery Service, and Google Earth (TerraMetrics and DigitalGlobe).</srccontr>
</srcinfo>
<procstep>
<procdesc>All features were attributed to conform to a subset of the NGS 'Coastal Cartographic Object Attribute Source Table' (C-COAST) attribution scheme. Current shoreline sources include individual National Shoreline projects, Lidar derived, automated feature extracted, monoscopically compiled, and non-NOAA sources of shoreline that were merged and stitched together and verified with contemporary imagery. The CUSP shoreline may include limited compilation from contemporary verification imagery (National Agriculture Imagery Program) if tidal influences minimally influenced the horizontal position. Some water courses were closed off with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory vectors. Edits may have been made to sections of the original shoreline vertices, as opposed to new compilation, to reflect the contemporary position.</procdesc>

Data for Rhode Island was downloaded from the NOAA Shoreline Data Explorer. These data were reprojected to the Rhode Island state plane feet coordinate system from geographic coordinates. Data were compared with RIGIS dataset Shoreline and Islands (1989) and there were many areas where the CUSP shoreline was a more accurate representation of current ground conditions. This assessment led to the inclusion of these data on the RIGIS website. 
While the CUSP data is compile from a variety of source types, from a variety of different collection dates, this shoreline will provide a good cartographic representation of the Rhode Island coastline.
